Lest Have a short explanation about each of them:


### environment.yaml

The first step to run the project is to prepare the environment we are planning to use. We have installed Anaconda to ease the setup of the environment.

To create the conda environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

This command will create a new environment based on the specifications in the `environment.yaml` file.

this will create a virtual environment named reproducible_dkt, to activate the environment use the comand:

```bash
conda activate reproducible_dkt
```
